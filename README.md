This is my cub3D game
I hope you like it

Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which is considered the first FPS ever created. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, where you will have to find your way.


things to do
- ✅ what to check if door is in the perimeter for the bonus projects? should we allow it or not?
  → **RESOLVED**: Doors are NOT allowed at map perimeter. Added door boundary validation to prevent holes in walls when doors are opened.
